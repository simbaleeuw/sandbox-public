I just added this message to the README.md. Now I am going to save the file using VS Code, but the work is not done with git!

Saving the file simply writes the new text to your hard disk. We need to tell git that we want to preserve these changes for the project (making a
"commit"), then send them
back to the repository on GitHub so the rest of our team can see them (this is "pushing to origin").

Make changes with the Web IDE!

Another remote commit was made that i want to fetch to my local repository and pull if there are no conflicts.

Here I added some text to see if it highlights the changes - Lucas
